# Hello, World!

<p>Welcome to your own sandbox to get started with coding, provided by CEFCU.  Attached in this repository
is the code that we used at the Career Spark event. By downloading this sample code, you can
expand on the ideas you may have had, but didn't have time to try out.  Feel free to use your imagination and make or
break anything that you want. If you reach a point of no return, that's okay!  You can always re-download the code,
and start over! Follow the instructions below to get started!

## Instructions
1. Click the "Clone or Download" button to the right
2. Click the "Download ZIP" button
    * Optionally, move the downloaded zip file to a different location like your Desktop or Documents
3. Follow [these](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028088/windows-zip-and-unzip-files)
instructions for unzipping the file
4. Once unzipped, open the **_index.html_** file in your favorite text editor
    * Below is a link to the free, Visual Studio Code, that we used at Career Spark
5. Make code changes in the **_index.html_** file and style changes in the **_styles.css_** file
    * If you've broken too many things, re-follow the instructions to start over
6. Have fun
